## 🌍 Overview

**Qazna.org** is an international, non-profit financial institution designed to serve as a **monetary coordination layer** for sovereign central banks, state treasuries, and licensed financial institutions.

The platform acts as a **digital counterpart to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)** —  
a **neutral infrastructure** where nations cooperate on emission, settlement, and liquidity in a transparent and mathematically balanced system.

Qazna is not a currency.  
It is the **protocol, infrastructure, and governance framework** through which digital sovereign money circulates safely, verifiably, and efficiently.

## 🎯 Mission

To build an open, scientifically grounded, and technologically verifiable global monetary system  
— one that maintains equilibrium instead of profit, trust instead of opacity,  
and collaboration instead of competition.

---

## 🧩 Core Principles

- **Neutrality:** no nation or institution owns Qazna.  
- **Transparency:** every operation is publicly auditable.  
- **Scientific Balance:** emission and liquidity follow formal, measurable equations.  
- **Open Governance:** all rules are defined and voted by member states.  
- **Security:** cryptographically verifiable transactions with post-quantum resilience.  
- **Sustainability:** energy- and computation-efficient infrastructure by design.

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview

Qazna is implemented as a **multi-language, modular system**, combining performance, auditability, and formal verification.

| Layer | Language / Tech | Description |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| **Core Runtime (Ledger & Ordering)** | Rust | Deterministic ledger engine, cryptographic accounting, consensus, and append-only event store. |
| **Service & API Layer** | Go (gRPC + Protobuf) | Microservice orchestration, authorization, auditing, and state reconciliation. |
| **Protocol & Models** | Protobuf / TLA+ | Formal specification of invariants and transaction logic. |
| **Integration SDKs** | Go, TypeScript, Python | Developer interfaces for banks, treasuries, and researchers. |
| **Data Layer** | PostgreSQL + FoundationDB + Kafka | Distributed, fault-tolerant storage and streaming analytics. |
| **Governance & Analytics** | AI-driven | Real-time balancing and emission feedback loop. |

## 🏛️ Governance

Qazna Foundation is governed under a **non-profit international charter**, ensuring neutrality, transparency, and scientific rigor.

**Core Bodies:**
1. **General Assembly** — sovereign members (central banks)  
2. **Executive Board** — operational leadership  
3. **Technical Secretariat** — manages code, protocols, and releases  
4. **Compliance Council** — ensures adherence to BIS, FATF, and ISO20022  
5. **Audit Committee** — independent verification and transparency reports

## 💰 Monetary and Fee Model

Qazna replaces the notion of “profit” with **equilibrium**.  
Fees are dynamically adjusted to preserve systemic balance and sustainability.

| Participant | Fee | Purpose |
|--------------|-----|----------|
| Central Banks | 0% | Sovereign participation |
| Financial Institutions | 0.01–0.05% | Cross-border settlement maintenance |
| Corporates | 0.1–0.2% | Computational and compliance overhead |
| Retail / P2P | 0% | Accessibility for all citizens |
